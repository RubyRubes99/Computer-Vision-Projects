This tutorial serves to teach users a simple method to detect hands or faces in real time without the use of neural networks. 

To run this notebook successfully, users require the following python packages installed:
1) numpy - pip install numpy
2) opencv - pip install opencv-python
3) matplotlib - pip install matplotlib

To ensure real time detection works, users require a webcam that can be accessed. The index of the webcam must be correctly selected.
